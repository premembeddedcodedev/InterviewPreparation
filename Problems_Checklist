3. Odd positions first and even positions last merging in linked list
	1. even pointer increment 2 times to reach even positions
	2. odd pointer increment 2 time to reach odd positions
	3. fitst odd positions need to increment because link will miss if we take even
	4. mege odd first and even linkedlist at the end of list;
