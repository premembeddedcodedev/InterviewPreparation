1. maximum-subarray
	1. Kadane's Algo
	2. bruteforce
	3. Path for example: CLogics/Logics/Arrays

2.Move Zeroes
	1. 2 pointer technique
	2. Path for example: ~/sambashare/Interview/CLogics/Logics/Arrays

3. Odd positions first and even positions last merging in linked list
	1. even pointer increment 2 times to reach even positions
	2. odd pointer increment 2 time to reach odd positions
	3. fitst odd positions need to increment because link will miss if we take even
	4. mege odd first and even linkedlist at the end of list;
	5. Path for example: DataStructures/LL

4. 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
	1. 2 pointers will maintain
	2. fast pointer will move N positions and then move along with slow pointer 1 by 1
	3. when fast pointer moved to last slow pointer will reach to N-1th node
	4. skip and point the slow node to N+1 and delete N nod
	5. Path for example: DataStructures/LL

5. 2. Add Two Numbers
	1. join the 2 lls with addition and maintain carry
	2. Path for example: DataStructures/LL

6. Group anagrams:
	1. hasmap
	2. Path for example: CLogics/Logics/Strings/LeetCode -- in progress
