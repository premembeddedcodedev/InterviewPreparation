Types of Linux drivers:

1. Character Device Drivers:
 - Character device drivers handle devices that transfer data character by character, such as keyboards, mice, serial ports, and terminals. These drivers typically implement the `read()` and `write()` operations for communication with user-space processes.

2. Block Device Drivers:
 - Block device drivers manage block-oriented devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and USB storage devices. They provide access to data in fixed-size blocks and support operations like reading, writing, and seeking.

3. Network Device Drivers:
 - Network device drivers control network interfaces, including Ethernet adapters, Wi-Fi cards, and network controllers. They handle the transmission and reception of network packets and implement protocols like TCP/IP.

4. Filesystem Drivers:
 - Filesystem drivers manage file systems supported by the Linux kernel, such as ext4, Btrfs, XFS, and FAT. They provide the interface between the kernel's virtual file system (VFS) layer and the physical storage media.

5. USB Drivers:
 - USB drivers support USB devices and peripherals, including keyboards, mice, printers, storage devices, and network adapters. They handle device enumeration, configuration, and communication over the USB bus.

6. PCI Drivers:
 - PCI drivers manage devices connected to the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) bus, such as graphics cards, network cards, and storage controllers. They handle device initialization, configuration, and communication.

7. I2C/SPI Drivers:
 - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) drivers control devices connected via the I2C or SPI bus, such as sensors, displays, and other embedded peripherals.

8. Framebuffer Drivers:
 - Framebuffer drivers manage framebuffers, which represent the video memory used for displaying graphics on a computer screen. They provide a generic interface for graphics hardware access.

9. Input Device Drivers:
 - Input device drivers handle input devices such as keyboards, mice, touchpads, and joysticks. They translate input events into kernel events that can be processed by user-space applications.

10. Sound Drivers:
 - Sound drivers control audio devices and provide support for sound playback, recording, and processing. They interact with audio hardware and manage audio streams.
